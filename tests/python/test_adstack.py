    # Reverse-mode AD must handle a triangular-nested loop, where an inner for-loop's upper bound is itself an
    # enclosing loop's index (a per-iteration value, not a loop invariant). The kernel mirrors a classic
    # lower-triangular sweep like an in-place Cholesky update. `w` additionally accumulates a linear function of
    # the outer counter alongside the inner sum, so both a per-iteration value and its reverse-mode gradient flow
    # are exercised. `x` entries are distinct (0.1, 0.2, ...) so the inner for's contribution to each `x.grad[k]`
    # differs per iteration; a uniform `x` would collapse several contributions into the same number and would
    # let a reverse pass over the wrong iteration range still match the expected sum.
    #
    # Internal details: two pieces of the autodiff pipeline are load-bearing together.
    # (1) AdStackAllocaJudger::visit(RangeForStmt) recognises allocas whose LocalLoad feeds a RangeForStmt begin or
    #     end and promotes them to an adstack, so each forward iteration pushes the current bound and each reverse
    #     iteration pops the matching one. This is the only promotion path for a pure loop-counter alloca (LOAD-only
    #     into the inner bound, no LOAD-then-STORE cycle), so the `local_loaded_` short-circuit in visit(LocalStoreStmt)
    #     cannot cover it. The comparison has to resolve the LocalLoad chain (compare `ll->src` to the backup, not
    #     the operand itself or the cursor) because `begin`/`end` are always value-producing stmts, not the alloca,
    #     and the mutable cursor only names the first matching load's instance.
    # (2) BackupSSA::visit(RangeForStmt) spills cross-block operands on the for-stmt itself (not just its body), so
    #     the reverse clone's `end` operand - pointing at the forward-scope AdStackLoadTop - is rematerialised via
    #     op->clone() inside the reverse scope (the existing AdStackLoadTopStmt branch in generic_visit).
    # Without either piece, this kernel fails: IR-verify reports `RangeForStmt cannot have operand LocalLoadStmt`
    # without (2); LLVM codegen hits "Instruction does not dominate all uses" without (2) after (1); or the reverse
    # inner-loop iteration count is the last forward value without (1), silently corrupting gradients for the
    # earliest inner indices (those visited most often across outer iterations) - bigger `n` exposes more affected
    # indices, which is why the parametrize sweep catches a regression that a single small `n` can alias past.

    # Pins that a reverse-mode kernel whose inner trip count is `fld[i] - arr[i]` - a scalar field
    # minus an ndarray element, both indexed by the outer loop variable - compiles and produces the
    # correct gradient on every supported backend.
    #
    # Internal details: the walker in `determine_ad_stack_size.cpp` wraps each operand of the inner
    # `Sub` in its own `MaxOverRange(i, 0, shape, leaf)` (`FieldLoad` on the field side,
    # `ExternalTensorRead` on the ndarray side); `expr_sub`'s `end_eq` branch then sees structurally-
    # equal `ExternalTensorShape(arr, 0)` ends and would fuse them into a single `MaxOverRange(v, 0,
    # shape, Sub(FieldLoad(fld, [v]), ExternalTensorRead(arr, [v])))`. The LLVM encoder's closed-
    # subtree lift only folds `FieldLoad` leaves with no free bound vars, so the mixed body - whose
    # `FieldLoad` carries the free `v` - falls through to `encode_subtree`'s `FieldLoad` branch and
    # hard-errors on the LLVM path (CUDA / AMDGPU have no on-device SNode access). The fusion must
    # therefore decline whenever its synthesised body would pair a bound-var-indexed `FieldLoad` with
    # an `ExternalTensorRead`; the unfused `Sub(MaxOverRange(i, 0, shape, FieldLoad), MaxOverRange(i,
    # 0, shape, ExternalTensorRead))` keeps each operand closed and host-foldable on both encoders.

    # SPIR-V launcher used to share a single grow-on-demand `AdStackMetadata` device buffer across every
    # task in a kernel. Per-task `(stride_float, stride_int, offset_i, max_size_i, ...)` tables were
    # host-memcpy'd into that buffer inside the cmdlist record loop, and the `bindings` descriptor for each
    # task's dispatch captured the same buffer handle. Record is host-synchronous but execute is deferred,
    # so by submit time the buffer holds only the LAST task's metadata and every dispatch in the cmdlist
    # reads those bytes. Earlier tasks then see shorter sibling stacks' `max_size` where their own should
    # be - e.g. a stack whose sizer wrote `max_size=9` observes a runtime `max_size=3`, its first guarded
    # push trips the `count < max_size` check at `count=3`, the overflow flag flips, and `qd.sync()` raises
    # even though the kernel's actual per-thread push count fits the per-stack bound the sizer computed.
    #
    # Internal details: `cfg_optimization=False` is load-bearing - with it enabled, the CFG pass sinks / merges
    # the bind-and-dispatch pair in a way that masks the cross-task buffer reuse on this kernel shape; with it
    # disabled the raw record-then-execute race surfaces. The pinned regression is SPIR-V-specific (the LLVM
    # path publishes metadata host-side via `publish_adstack_metadata` directly into each launch's own
    # `AdStackSizingInfo` with no cross-task aliasing), but the test runs on every backend so a future
    # regression in either path that produces wrong values rather than an overflow is still caught. The kernel
    # shape (two sibling `qd.ndrange` offloads, the second one carrying a triangular i<=j<k nested loop that
    # stashes a multiplicative reduction onto its own adstack) is the minimum that exhibits the bug: you need
    # at least two tasks in the same kernel so the second task's record overwrites the first task's metadata
    # before submit. The post-fix runtime allocates a fresh metadata buffer per task record and retires it into
    # `ctx_buffers_` so it stays alive until the sync window closes.
