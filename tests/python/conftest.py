    This is necessary to prevent random test failures when testing with ndarray.

    ndarray comprises two separate objects:
    - a c++ side ndarray, which then links the actual data, and contains metadata around
      the shape, and so on
      - let's call this 'ndarray-cpp'
    - a python side ndarray object, that represents the c++ side ndarray, from pybind11
      - let's call this 'ndarray-pybind'
    - a python side ndarray object, that is created independently of the pybind11-created
      python side ndarray object
      - let's call this 'ndarray-py'

    pybind11 is configured such that ownership of ndarray-cpp is NOT passed to the python side

    However, pybind-py has a __del__ method on it, which is called when pybind-py is garbage-
    collected
    - when pybind-py __del__ is called, it calls a c++ method, via pybind, to delete the
      underling ndarray-cpp

    When qd.init() or similar is called, during tests, ndarray-cpp is no longer considered allocated
    - however ndarray-cp has not yet been garbage collected, still exists, and still has a pointer
      to where the ndarray-cpp used to be
    - on mac os x, it regularly happens, as an artifact of how memory management works, that new
      ndarray-cpps are allocated with the exact same address as the old one
    - when garbage collection runs, __del__ is called on the old ndarray-py
        - causing the new ndarray-cpp to be deleted
        - at this point => crash bug

    By calling gc.collect after each test, we avoid this issue.
