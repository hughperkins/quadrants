# Supported systems

## CI Tested systems

We test the following systems in our CI servers:
- Python 3.10-Python 3.13
- Mac OS X 14 and 15
- Ubuntu 22.04 and Ubuntu 24.04
- Windows Server 2025

## Supported systems:

### Operating systems
- Mac Silicon 14 or 15
- Ubuntu 22.04 and 24.04 (x64 and ARM64)
- Windows 10 or later (x86 only)

### GPUs

- CUDA GPUs, Pascal or later (>=sm_60)
- Metal GPUs
- AMD GPUs
- Vulkan-compatible GPUs (e.g. Intel Arc)

### Backend / OS matrix

Which backends are available on each supported platform. `qd.cpu` and `qd.vulkan` run on every OS; the other GPU backends are platform-specific because they wrap vendor drivers (CUDA on NVIDIA, ROCm on AMD, Metal on Apple).

| OS \ backend | `qd.cpu` | `qd.cuda` | `qd.amdgpu` | `qd.metal` | `qd.vulkan` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | yes | n/a | n/a | yes | yes |
| Linux x64 | yes | yes | yes | n/a | yes |
| Linux ARM64 | yes | no | no | n/a | yes |
| Windows x86 | yes | yes | no | n/a | yes |
| Windows ARM64 | yes | no | no | n/a | yes |

Notes:
- `qd.cuda` requires an NVIDIA driver + CUDA runtime on the host; quadrants links against the CUDA runtime discovered at import time. NVIDIA ships CUDA for Linux ARM64 and Windows ARM64, but quadrants does not support them yet.
- `qd.amdgpu` currently wires up the Linux x64 ROCm path only. AMD's HIP SDK also ships on Windows and on some Linux ARM64 targets, but quadrants does not support them yet.
- `qd.metal` is only available on Apple hardware and is the recommended GPU backend there.
- `qd.vulkan` on macOS ships a bundled MoltenVK dylib inside the wheel, so no separate MoltenVK install is required.

### Python backend

A pure-Python backend (`qd.python`) is available on any system where PyTorch is installed. See [Python backend](./python_backend.md).
